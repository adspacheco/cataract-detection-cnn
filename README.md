# Cataract Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project demonstrates the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for cataract detection in eye images. 

The Jupyter Notebook, `cnn-catarata.ipynb`, was created during the execution of this project, where key concepts and techniques in image classification with CNNs were applied. 

It guides the user through data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation, providing a comprehensive overview of the entire workflow. 

Please note that the notebook is written in Portuguese ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

## How to Use (Google Colab)

To run the notebook in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1.  Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2.  Click on "File" -> "Open Notebook"
3.  Select "GitHub" and enter the URL of this repository
4.  Choose the `cnn-catarata.ipynb` notebook to open it
5.  Run each cell sequentially to execute the code and follow the instructions provided within the notebook.
